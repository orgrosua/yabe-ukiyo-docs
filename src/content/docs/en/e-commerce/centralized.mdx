Yabe Ukiyo allows you to create a centralized e-commerce setup for multiple remote template libraries. This means you can sell template libraries from a single website, while the actual template libraries are hosted on different websites.

This feature is in its early stages, is not yet fully implemented, and only works with Easy Digital Downloads.

There are two main components to this feature:
- **Managed Site**: The site that hosts the actual template libraries.
- **Central Site**: The site that sells the template libraries and connects to the managed sites.

## Managed Site
